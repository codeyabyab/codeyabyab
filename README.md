- 👋 Hello, I’m @codeyabyab
- 👀 I’m interested in Game Development and Web Development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the fundamentals of Web Development ranging from basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript to advanced frameworks and libraries like React and Laravel. I'm also learning Godot in my spare time.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on a project, just yet.
